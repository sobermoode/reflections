Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: Using a remote repository would be a good idea whenever you wanted to open up your project 
to outside collaboration, or if you knew you would need to access your project from another 
machine. In the first instance, you might ask for assistance in solving a problem and invite 
others to add solutions to your project. Or, you might develop a project locally, 
and then decide to release it as open-source, to allow anyone to make changes to the master 
branch, or continue to add their own features and customizations in their own branches 
(which you could then incorporate back into your own branch). In the second instance, you 
might be working on your project from home on a desktop machine, and you don't have a laptop, 
and you have to go to a friend's house, but you know your friend has another desktop computer 
that you can use. You can create a remote repository and then clone your project onto your 
friend's computer. You can continue to work on the project on your friend's computer, 
commit your work to the remote, and then pull that content back onto your own machine once 
you get home.

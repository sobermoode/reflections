Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: when a repository is initialized, a hidden .git folder is created within the directory
you made the initialization in. this folder will then contain the log of all the git
snapshots of your project. by default, none of the files currently within the directory
that you initialize the git repository in will be committed to the repository. 
initializing the repository creates a blank slate for you to begin your project with.
you can specify the files you want to track by adding them to the repository and start
adding log messages to help track the development of the project.


Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: the repository contains all of the snapshots of your project that youve committed. files that are
in your working directory and have been edited can be part of any commit that you make to the
repository. however, not every file in the working directory may need to be edited before a commit
is made. all files being tracked by the repository will be added to the commit, though. for 
any given commit, some files in the working directory may or may not be added to the repository for
that commit, if they are not being tracked at the time. the staging area doesnt really "contain" files.
it is a temporary batters box where the files that are going to be committed are placed before 
the actual commit is made. before making a commit, it is a good idea to see which files youve edited,
which files the repository is tracking, and make sure that all the files that need to be committed are
being tracked, as well as possibly removing any files that it isnt necessary to continue tracking. 
the staging area is a useful tool for this. it allows you to maintain a high-magnification look at
the detail of your repository and how commits will affect it.
